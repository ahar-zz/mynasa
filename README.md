•            Write a Java application to get a list of “Near Earth Objects” using the NASA RESTful Web Service https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS

•            Identify which NEO is the largest in size and which is the closest to Earth – this requires your judgment. Output the total number of NEOs, and the details retrieved for both the largest and closest NEOs identified.

•            Provide proof that code is functional. It must be possible to download, build and run the application on any platform where Java is installed.
